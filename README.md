# BearShell CPP

BearShellCPP is a rudimentary shell, written in C++. At the current moment it's features are VERY limited. This Shell does serve as a project for me to learn C++ - just like nearly everything else in my repositories. ;)

## Usage

Just compile and execute it. It should work with every system. 

## List of commands

info - displays information about the shell.

echo - echoes user entry back.

commlist - shows the integrated list of commands.

rfile - reads from a user specified file.

lyrica - reads from lyrica.txt

##About lyrica.txt
lyrica.txt is a textfile which currently serves as a simple to-do-file.

## Planned additions

    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

...whatever comes to my mind will be added to the shell. ;)
