# BearShell CPP

BearShellCPP is a rudimentary shell, written in C++. At the current moment it's features are VERY limited. This Shell does serve as a project for me to learn C++.

## Usage

Compile it - please check if correct paths are entered in comms.h - otherwise functions like changeshellusr won't work properly.

BearShellCPP is designed for usage with Windows.

## List of commands

Type help for a list of commands.

## About lyrica.txt
lyrica.txt is a textfile which currently serves as a simple to-do-file.

## Planned additions

    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

...whatever comes to my mind will be added to the shell. ;)
